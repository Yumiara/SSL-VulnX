TTJY is an online alias used by a content creator and developer known for contributing scripts and tools in the Roblox gaming community. They maintain a GitHub profile with open-source repositories and produce tutorials and showcases—especially for games like The Mimic. A corresponding YouTube channel highlights these tools in video form. However, no personal identity or background details are publicly available.

Under “The Mimic” section, users can find detailed walkthroughs and showcases of automated scripts tailored for different chapters of the game. There is a focus on Jealousy Chapter IV, with known issues and direct links to bug fix scripts. Tutorials are presented in both English and Thai, allowing broader accessibility for users. Each issue reported by the community is tracked and categorized, along with recommended executors that are compatible or problematic.

The “Grow A Garden” section follows a similar structure, offering a showcase of how automation works in that game, with visual references and reports on bugs or patch updates. This section also includes user-submitted fixes and script testing results.

Overall, the Flow GitBook serves as a living manual for players who use automation or scripting tools in Roblox. It is updated actively, and its clean categorization ensures that users can easily find what they’re looking for, whether it’s a working script, a compatible executor, or a solution to a known issue.
